# BootMine

*Ever wanted to play minesweeper but didn't have an OS to run it in? No? Really no??*

BootMine is an entire minesweeper game crammed into 512 bytes, the size of a BIOS boot sector. It can boot on any PC that supports BIOS booting, without running inside an OS. In a sense, BootMine is its own OS that can do nothing but run minesweeper.

## Building

Make sure `nasm` and `make` are installed, then run:

```sh
make
```

Alternatively, prebuilt versions can be downloaded from the
[releases page](https://github.com/io12/BootMine/releases).

## Installing

The 512-byte file `bootmine.img` can be written to the first sector of a floppy disk (or USB drive), with a command like `dd if=bootmine.img of=/dev/sdb`. Keep in mind that this will effectively destroy all data on the drive.

### Emulation

Makefile targets are provided for emulating in QEMU and Bochs.

```sh
make qemu
```

```sh
make bochs
```

**NOTE**: The way Bochs implements the `rdtsc` instruction appears to be bad as a source of entropy, so the bomb locations are predictable.

## DOS

BootMine has DOS support too! Running `make` also produces `bootmine.com` that can be run in DOS. There are Makefile targets for easily running in DOSBox and DOSEMU.

```sh
make dosbox
```

```sh
make dosemu
```
